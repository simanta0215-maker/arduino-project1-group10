int LED = 13; // Declares an integer variable "LED" to store the digital pin number (8)

// Step#2: Adding an integer variable named "counter" to track the number of blinks
int counter = 0; // Initializing the counter variable to start from 0

void setup()

  // Put our setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // Setting LED pin as an OUTPUT

 
  Serial.begin(9600); // Opens serial port and sets data rate to 9600 bps
}

void loop()
{
  // Put our main code here, to run repeatedly:

  // Step#3: Increment the loop counter by 1 in every iteration.
  counter = counter + 1; // Alternative shorthand: counter++;

 
  Serial.print("Blink Number # "); // Printing text value only (String)
  Serial.println(counter);         // Printing the counter value on a new line

  // Turning the LED on
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);

  // Turning the LED off
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  delay(500); // Waiting for 500ms (0.5 seconds) with LED OFF
